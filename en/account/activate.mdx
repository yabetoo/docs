Immediately after you create a Yabetoo account, you can use your account in testing environments. In a sandbox, simulate transactions and use all of Yabetoo's features without moving any money. To accept real payments, you must activate your account to use live mode.

## Activate your account

To activate your account, you need to provide some basic information about your business, product, and your personal relationship to your business. After activating your account, you can immediately start accepting live payments.

Yabetoo's "Know Your Customer" (KYC) obligations require that we collect and maintain this information on all Yabetoo users. These requirements come from our regulators and financial partners, and are intended to prevent abuse of the financial system. We review the information you provide internally to make sure that it complies with our services agreement. We’ll contact you if we need any further information.

## Public business information

Your customers see the following details on either their card statements or in email receipts sent by Yabetoo.

- Business name
- Business address
- Business phone number
- Business email address
- Business website

You provide this information when you activate your account, and can update it any time in your Account settings. Make sure that your statement descriptor text and business information are clearly associated with you.
