This glossary defines the key terms and concepts you'll encounter when working with Yabetoo.

## A

### API Key
A unique identifier used to authenticate requests to the Yabetoo API. There are two types:
- **Secret Key** (`sk_test_` or `sk_live_`): Used server-side, must be kept confidential
- **Public Key** (`pk_test_` or `pk_live_`): Can be used client-side

### Account ID
Your unique merchant identifier in Yabetoo. Found in your [dashboard](https://app.yabetoo.com/developers) and required for some API calls.

## C

### Checkout Session
A hosted payment page created by Yabetoo. You redirect customers to this page to complete payment, and they're redirected back to your site afterward.

### Client Secret
A unique token associated with a Payment Intent. Used to confirm the payment and prevent unauthorized modifications.

### Confirm
The action of finalizing a Payment Intent by providing the customer's payment method details. This triggers the actual payment.

## D

### Disbursement
A payout from your Yabetoo account to a customer's Mobile Money account. Used to send money to recipients (refunds, payouts, rewards, etc.).

## I

### Intent
See [Payment Intent](#payment-intent).
