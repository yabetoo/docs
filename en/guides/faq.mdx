## Technical Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Payment Intents and Checkout Sessions?">
    **Payment Intents** give you full control over the payment UI. You collect customer information and call the API directly.

    **Checkout Sessions** provide a hosted payment page. Yabetoo handles the UI, and you redirect customers to complete payment.

    Use Checkout Sessions for simpler integration, and Payment Intents for custom payment flows.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I test payments without real money?">
    Use the sandbox environment with test API keys (`sk_test_`). We provide test phone numbers that simulate different payment outcomes. See our [Testing guide](/en/developer-tools/test/overview).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long do payments take to process?">
    Mobile Money payments typically complete within 10-60 seconds. The customer needs to:
    1. Receive the notification on their phone
    2. Enter their PIN to confirm

    If the customer doesn't respond, the payment times out after about 90 seconds.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if a payment fails?">
    When a payment fails, you receive a `failed` status with a `failure_message` explaining the reason. Common reasons include:
    - Insufficient funds
    - Customer rejected the payment
    - Invalid phone number
    - Timeout (customer didn't respond)

    You can allow customers to retry failed payments.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to verify webhook signatures?">
    Yes, you should always verify webhook signatures to ensure requests are genuinely from Yabetoo. This prevents malicious actors from sending fake payment confirmations to your server.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I refund a payment?">
    Contact our support team at support@yabetoopay.com to process refunds. We'll work with you to return funds to the customer.
  </Accordion>

## Account & Security

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I keep my API keys secure?">
    - Never expose secret keys in client-side code
    - Store keys in environment variables
    - Use different keys for development and production
    - Regenerate keys if you suspect they've been compromised
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between test and live keys?">
    **Test keys** (`sk_test_`, `pk_test_`) work only in the sandbox environment. No real money is moved.

    **Live keys** (`sk_live_`, `pk_live_`) process real payments in production. Keep these extra secure.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I switch from sandbox to production?">
    1. Verify your account is activated for live payments
    2. Replace your test API key with your live key
    3. Update the API URL from `pay.sandbox.yabetoopay.com` to `pay.api.yabetoopay.com`
    4. Test with a small real payment before going fully live
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where do I find my account ID?">
    Your account ID is available in your [dashboard](https://app.yabetoo.com/developers). It's required for some API calls like creating checkout sessions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Disbursements & Remittances

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between disbursements and remittances?">
    **Disbursements** are payouts from your Yabetoo account to a customer's Mobile Money account.

    **Remittances** are transfers, typically used for cross-border or scheduled payments.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How quickly are disbursements processed?">
    Disbursements are typically processed within a few minutes. The recipient receives the funds directly in their Mobile Money account.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a limit on disbursement amounts?">
    Limits depend on your account configuration and the Mobile Money provider's limits. Contact support for details about your specific limits.
  </Accordion>
