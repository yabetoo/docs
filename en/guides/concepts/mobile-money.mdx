Mobile Money is the primary payment method supported by Yabetoo. This guide explains how it works and how to integrate it into your application.

## What is Mobile Money?

Mobile Money is a digital payment service that allows users to store, send, and receive money using their mobile phone. It's widely used in Africa where traditional banking infrastructure is limited.

## Supported Operators

Yabetoo currently supports the following Mobile Money operators:

| Operator | Code | Countries | Description |
|----------|------|-----------|-------------|
| MTN MoMo | `mtn` | Congo-Brazzaville | MTN Mobile Money |
| Airtel Money | `airtel` | Congo-Brazzaville | Airtel Money |

## How Mobile Money Payments Work

### 1. Customer Initiates Payment

The customer provides their phone number and selects their Mobile Money operator.

### 2. Payment Request Sent

Yabetoo sends a payment request to the Mobile Money provider.

### 3. Customer Receives Notification

The customer receives a push notification (USSD prompt) on their phone asking them to confirm the payment.

### 4. Customer Enters PIN

The customer enters their Mobile Money PIN to authorize the transaction.

### 5. Payment Confirmed

The Mobile Money provider confirms the payment and notifies Yabetoo.

## Integration Example

When confirming a payment intent, you must provide the Mobile Money details:

```javascript
const confirmation = await fetch(
  "https://pay.sandbox.yabetoopay.com/v1/payment-intents",
  {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      Authorization: "Bearer sk_test_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      client_secret: "pi_xxx_secret_xxx",
      payment_method_data: {
        type: "momo",
        momo: {
          country: "cg",
          msisdn: "+242066594470",
          operator_name: "mtn",
        },
      },
    }),
  }
);
```

### Required Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `type` | string | Always `"momo"` for Mobile Money |
| `momo.country` | string | Country code (e.g., `"cg"` for Congo) |
| `momo.msisdn` | string | Phone number in international format |
| `momo.operator_name` | string | Operator code (`"mtn"` or `"airtel"`) |

## Phone Number Format

Phone numbers must be in international format:

| Format | Example | Valid |
|--------|---------|-------|
| With country code | `+242066594470` | Yes |
| With country code (no +) | `242066594470` | Yes |
| Local format | `066594470` | No |

## Country Codes

| Country | Code | Phone Prefix |
|---------|------|--------------|
| Congo-Brazzaville | `cg` | +242 |

## Handling Mobile Money Specifics

### Timeout Considerations

Mobile Money transactions can take longer than card payments because:
- The customer needs to receive the push notification
- They need to manually enter their PIN
- Network latency with Mobile Money providers

<Tip>
  Set a reasonable timeout (60-90 seconds) when waiting for payment confirmation.
</Tip>

### Common Failure Reasons

| Reason | Description | User Action |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `PAYER_NOT_FOUND` | Phone number not registered with operator | Verify the phone number |
| `LOW_BALANCE` | Insufficient funds | Top up Mobile Money account |
| `APPROVAL_REJECTED` | Customer rejected the payment | Ask customer to try again |
| `TIMEOUT` | Customer didn't respond in time | Retry the payment |

## Testing Mobile Money

In the sandbox environment, use these test numbers:

### Successful Payments
- `242066000001` (Airtel Money) - Always succeeds
- Any other number (MTN MoMo) - Always succeeds

### Failed Payments
- `242050017890` (Airtel) - Internal error
- `46733123451` (MTN) - Rejected
- `46733123455` (MTN) - Payer not found

<Note>
  See the [Testing guide](/en/developer-tools/test/overview) for the complete list of test numbers.
</Note>

## Best Practices

1. **Validate phone numbers** - Ensure the format is correct before sending
2. **Show clear instructions** - Tell users to expect a notification on their phone
3. **Handle timeouts gracefully** - Allow users to retry if they missed the prompt
4. **Store operator preference** - Remember the user's preferred operator for future payments
