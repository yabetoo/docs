title: Error Handling
description: Understand and handle API errors effectively.
---

The Yabetoo API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

## HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `200` | OK | Request succeeded |
| `201` | Created | Resource created successfully |
| `400` | Bad Request | Invalid request parameters |
| `401` | Unauthorized | Invalid or missing API key |
| `403` | Forbidden | Insufficient permissions |
| `404` | Not Found | Resource does not exist |
| `429` | Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded |
| `500` | Internal Server Error | Server-side error |

## Payment Error Codes

When a payment fails, the API returns specific error codes to help you understand what went wrong:

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `LOW_BALANCE_OR_PAYEE_LIMIT_REACHED_OR_NOT_ALLOWED` | The customer has insufficient funds, has reached their transaction limit, or the transaction is not allowed by the operator |
| `TIMEOUT` | The customer did not confirm the payment in time (did not enter their PIN) |

### Example Error Response

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "LOW_BALANCE_OR_PAYEE_LIMIT_REACHED_OR_NOT_ALLOWED",
    "code": "LOW_BALANCE_OR_PAYEE_LIMIT_REACHED_OR_NOT_ALLOWED"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always handle errors gracefully** - Never expose raw error messages to end users
2. **Log errors for debugging** - Store error details for troubleshooting
3. **Implement retry logic** - For rate limits and temporary failures
4. **Validate before sending** - Check parameters client-side to reduce errors

  If you encounter persistent errors, contact support@yabetoopay.com with the error details.
