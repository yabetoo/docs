## Welcome to the Yabetoo API

The Yabetoo API is organized around REST principles, featuring predictable resource-oriented URLs, JSON request and response bodies, and standard HTTP response codes. Our API is designed to be simple, secure, and developer-friendly.

    Sign up and obtain your API keys from the [developer
    dashboard](https://app.yabetoopay.com)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make Your First Request">
    Test the API by creating a checkout session or payment intent
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle Webhooks">

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using your secret API key. Include your key in the Authorization header of every request:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer your_secret_key_here
```

<Warning>
  Never expose your secret API keys in client-side code. Always make API calls
  from your server.
</Warning>

## Request Format

The Yabetoo API accepts JSON-formatted request bodies and returns JSON responses. Always include the appropriate Content-Type header:

```bash
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.yabetoopay.com/v1/checkout-sessions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 2000,
    "currency": "EUR",
    "success_url": "https://yoursite.com/success",
    "cancel_url": "https://yoursite.com/cancel"
  }'

## HTTP Status Codes

The Yabetoo API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure:

| Code  | Description                                             |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `200` | Success - Request completed successfully                |
| `201` | Created - Resource created successfully                 |
| `400` | Bad Request - Invalid request parameters                |
| `401` | Unauthorized - Invalid or missing API key               |
| `402` | Payment Required - Insufficient funds or failed payment |
| `403` | Forbidden - Access denied                               |
| `404` | Not Found - Resource not found                          |
| `429` | Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded                 |
| `500` | Internal Server Error - Something went wrong on our end |

## Error Handling

When an error occurs, the API returns a JSON object with error details:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "code": "parameter_missing",
    "message": "Missing required parameter: amount",
    "param": "amount"
  }
}
```

### Error Types

- `api_error` - Issues with our API
- `authentication_error` - Problems with your API key
- `invalid_request_error` - Invalid parameters or format
- `rate_limit_error` - Too many requests
- `payment_error` - Payment processing failed

## Rate Limiting

The Yabetoo API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage:

- **Test Mode**: 100 requests per minute
- **Live Mode**: 1000 requests per minute

Rate limit information is included in response headers:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1609459200
```

## Pagination

List endpoints support pagination using `limit` and `offset` parameters:

```bash
GET /v1/payment-intents?limit=20&offset=40
```

Response includes pagination metadata:

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "has_more": true,
  "total": 150
}
```

## Idempotency

Safely retry requests by including an `Idempotency-Key` header with a unique value:

```bash
Idempotency-Key: your-unique-key-here
```

This prevents duplicate processing if you need to retry a request.

## Versioning

The current API version is `v1`. We maintain backward compatibility and announce changes well in advance. Specify the API version in your requests:

```bash
GET https://api.yabetoopay.com/v1/payment-intents
```
