description: Getting started guide for the Yabetoo API.
---

The Yabetoo API is organized around REST principles. Our API uses predictable endpoints with URL-oriented resources, accepts JSON-encoded requests, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP status codes.

## Base URL

```bash
https://pay.api.yabetoopay.com    # Production
https://pay.sandbox.yabetoopay.com # Sandbox
```

## Authentication

The Yabetoo API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can manage your API keys in the [dashboard](https://app.yabetoo.com/developers).

All API requests must be made over HTTPS and must include your API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer sk_test_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

## Request Formats

### Content-Type

For POST and PUT requests, the body must be JSON-encoded with the header:

```bash
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Pagination Parameters

For endpoints that return lists, use these parameters:

- `limit`: Number of items per page (default: 10, max: 100)
- `page`: Page number (starts at 1)

## Responses

### Structure

All responses are in JSON with this structure:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    // Response data
  },
  "message": "Optional description"
}
```

### HTTP Codes

- `200`: Success
- `201`: Resource created
- `400`: Invalid request
- `401`: Not authenticated
- `403`: Not authorized
- `404`: Resource not found
- `429`: Too many requests
- `500`: Server error

## Error Handling

In case of an error, you will receive:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_request",
    "message": "Error description",
    "details": {
      // Additional details if available
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>
  Keep your API keys secure. Never share them publicly or in
  client-side code.
