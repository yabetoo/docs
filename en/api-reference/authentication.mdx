description: Learn how to authenticate your API requests with Yabetoo.
---

The Yabetoo API uses API keys to authenticate requests. This guide explains how to obtain, use, and secure your API keys.

## API Key Types

Yabetoo provides two types of API keys:

| Key Type | Prefix | Environment | Purpose |
|----------|--------|-------------|---------|
| Test Key | `sk_test_` | Sandbox | Development and testing |
| Live Key | `sk_live_` | Production | Real transactions |

<Warning>
  Never use your live API key in test environments or expose it in client-side code.
</Warning>

## Obtaining Your API Keys

1. Log in to your [Yabetoo Dashboard](https://app.yabetoo.com)
2. Navigate to **Developers** or go directly to [app.yabetoo.com/developers](https://app.yabetoo.com/developers)
3. Copy your test or live API key

## Using API Keys

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.yabetoopay.com/v1/payment-intents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 5000, "currency": "XAF"}'
```

### SDK Examples

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript
import Yabetoo from '@yabetoo/sdk';

const yabetoo = new Yabetoo('sk_test_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX');
```

```python Python
import yabetoo

yabetoo.api_key = 'sk_test_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
```

```php PHP
<?php
\Yabetoo\Yabetoo::setApiKey('sk_test_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX');
```

```java Java
import com.yabetoo.Yabetoo;

Yabetoo.apiKey = "sk_test_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX";
```
</CodeGroup>

## Security Best Practices

### Store Keys Securely

- Use environment variables to store API keys
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use a secrets manager in production (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)

```bash
# .env file (never commit this file)
YABETOO_API_KEY=sk_test_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

```javascript
// Access from environment
const yabetoo = new Yabetoo(process.env.YABETOO_API_KEY);
```

### Restrict Key Access

- Only give API keys to team members who need them
- Use different keys for different environments
- Rotate keys periodically

## Regenerating API Keys

If you suspect your API key has been compromised:

1. Go to **Developers** in your [dashboard](https://app.yabetoo.com/developers)
2. Click **Regenerate** next to the compromised key
3. Update your application with the new key
4. The old key will be immediately invalidated

<Warning>
  Regenerating a key immediately invalidates the old key. Ensure your application is updated before regenerating.
</Warning>

## Account ID

Some endpoints require an `accountId` parameter. This is your merchant account identifier, found in your [dashboard](https://app.yabetoo.com/developers).

```javascript
const session = await yabetoo.sessions.create({
  total: 5000,
  currency: 'XAF',
  accountId: 'acct_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX', // Your account ID
  successUrl: 'https://example.com/success',
  cancelUrl: 'https://example.com/cancel'
});
```
