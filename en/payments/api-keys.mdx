# Introduction

Before you can integrate any Yabetoo Pay product or solution, you need to configure your development environment to obtain the OAuth 2.0 client identifier and secret credentials for both sandbox and production environments.

You exchange these credentials for an access token that authorizes your REST API calls. To test your web and mobile applications, you create sandbox accounts.

## Obtaining Your API Keys

To generate REST API credentials for the sandbox:

1. Create an account by clicking [here](https://app.yabetoopay.com).
2. You will then be invited to create a store.
3. You will find your API keys in the developer tab.

API keys are specific to each store and are strictly personal - you should never share them with third parties.

Your secret key allows you to interact with Yabetoo APIs.

<Note>
  Keep your API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code. Always
  use them on your server-side applications only.
</Note>

## API Key Types

### Test Keys

- **Purpose**: For development and testing
- **Environment**: Sandbox
- **Transactions**: No real money processed
- **Prefix**: Usually starts with `test_`

### Live Keys

- **Purpose**: For production transactions
- **Environment**: Production
- **Transactions**: Real money processed
- **Prefix**: Usually starts with `live_`

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
  Your secret keys can perform any action on your account. Treat them like
  passwords: - Never share them publicly - Don't include them in client-side
  code - Use environment variables to store them - Rotate them regularly -
  Monitor their usage
</Warning>

### Environment Variables

Store your keys securely using environment variables:

```bash
# .env file
YABETOO_TEST_SECRET_KEY=test_your_secret_key_here
YABETOO_LIVE_SECRET_KEY=live_your_secret_key_here
```

### Code Example

```php
// PHP example
$secretKey = $_ENV['YABETOO_TEST_SECRET_KEY']; // Use test key for development
// $secretKey = $_ENV['YABETOO_LIVE_SECRET_KEY']; // Use live key for production

$yabetoo = new YabetooClient($secretKey);
```

## Making REST API Calls

Once you have your API keys, you can start making authenticated requests to the Yabetoo API. Include your secret key in the Authorization header:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.yabetoopay.com/v1/checkout-sessions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_secret_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 1000,
    "currency": "EUR",
    "success_url": "https://yoursite.com/success",
    "cancel_url": "https://yoursite.com/cancel"
  }'
```
