## Prepare your request

The endpoint to use is `GET https://pay.sandbox.yabetoopay.com/v1/disbursements` for sandbox environment and `GET https://pay.api.yabetoopay.com/v1/disbursements` for production environment.

<Note>
  Secret key security: The secret key (secret_key) must be kept confidential and
  must never be exposed in the frontend or client code. It must only be used on
  the server side.
</Note>

1. Use the secret key provided `secret_key` to authenticate yourself to the API. For security reasons, this key must only be used on the server side.
2. You can use the following optional query parameters:

- `limit`: Maximum number of disbursements to return (default: 10, max: 100)
- `starting_after`: A cursor for use in pagination. `starting_after` is the ID of a disbursement that defines your place in the list.
- `ending_before`: A cursor for use in pagination. `ending_before` is the ID of a disbursement that defines your place in the list.

## Make the request

```javascript
const response = await fetch(
  "https://pay.sandbox.yabetoopay.com/v1/disbursements?limit=10",
  {
    method: "GET",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      Authorization: `Bearer ${secret_key}`,
    },
  }
);

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
