Disbursements are payments from your account to a customer's account. This is a one-time payment that is used to transfer funds from your account to a customer's account.

<Note>
  Please note that the disbursement API is available exclusively to partner
  accounts. To obtain access to this functionality, please send us a request.

## Disbursement: Asynchronous processing

A disbursement is processed asynchronously, meaning that the API will return a response immediately, but the actual payment may take some time to complete generally D+1 after the request has been created. This is due to the need to verify the customer's account and process the payment.

## Notification via Webhook

A webhook is a callback URL that is called when a disbursement is created or updated. This allows you to receive notifications about the status of the disbursement and take appropriate action.

To be informed in real time of a disbursement's execution, you need to create a webhook of type `disbursement.complete`.

This webhook is triggered automatically as soon as the disbursement is actually executed.
