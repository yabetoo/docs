---

The Remittance feature enables partner businesses to act as money transfer operators by sending funds from their Yabetoo business account to end beneficiaries (customers, individuals, or companies) on behalf of their own users.

Unlike the standard transfer feature—which allows merchants to send funds from their account for their own use—remittance is designed for businesses that offer money transfer services to third parties.

## Purpose & Benefits

The Remittance API allows you to:

- Transfer funds **on behalf of a third-party user** (agent, customer, or end recipient).
- Enrich transfers with **custom metadata** (internal reference, user ID, transfer channel, etc.).
- **Track transaction status** in real time (`pending`, `processing`, `succeeded`, `failed`).
- Receive **webhook notifications** as remittance status changes.
- Manage remittance operations through a **secure, flexible API**.

## Common Use Cases

| Use Case                      | Description                                                                                                              |

| **Money Transfer Platform**   | A fintech app allows users to send money to relatives. The platform uses the Remittance API to process the transactions. |
| **Mass Payouts**              | A company or NGO distributes funds to multiple beneficiaries (e.g., salaries, commissions, aid).                         |
| **In-person Agent Transfer**  | A physical agent uses a Yabetoo-connected interface to initiate transfers for walk-in customers.                         |
| **Service Payment on Behalf** | The partner pays bills or services for their end users (e.g., tuition fees, electricity).                                |

## Who is it for?

The Remittance feature is available for **approved partners** whose business model includes processing payouts on behalf of third parties, such as:
