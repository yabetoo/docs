## Hosted Checkout Page Overview

Yabetoo provides a **hosted checkout page** â€” a secure, easy-to-integrate solution that allows you to accept payments without handling sensitive payment data directly.

Using our **Checkout Sessions**, you can redirect your customers to a professionally designed payment page hosted by Yabetoo, where they can complete their purchase securely. This approach is similar to solutions like Stripe Checkout.

### Advantages of Using a Checkout Session

The use of a hosted checkout page offers several advantages for you as a developer or merchant.

- **Security** : Yabetoo manages payment security, allowing you to focus on your application.
- **Compliance** : By using a hosted checkout page, you reduce your PCI compliance burden, as Yabetoo handles sensitive information.
- **User Experience** : The checkout page is optimized for a smooth and fast user experience.
- **Customization** : You can customize the appearance of the checkout page to match your brand.

### Checkout Session Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Checkout Session">
    When you create a session, you send the information about the items, the
    total amount, the currency, and the redirect URLs (for success or cancel).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Hosted Checkout Page">
    Yabetoo returns a unique URL that you can use to redirect users to the
    hosted payment page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Payment Confirmation">
    Once the payment is completed with success, the user is redirected to the
    URL you specified in successUrl, with the transaction details. If the user
    cancels, they will be redirected to the URL defined in cancelUrl.
  </Step>
</Steps>
