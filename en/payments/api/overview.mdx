Yabetoo works on a two-step payment model. This means that, to process a payment, you must first create a payment intent and then confirm this intent to capture the amount.

This approach offers greater flexibility, allowing you to check available funds, for example, or to obtain a user's authorization before finalizing a transaction. Here's how it works, step by step
