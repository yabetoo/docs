## Create a Checkout Session

Add an endpoint on your server that creates a Checkout session. A Checkout session controls the information your customer can see on the payment page, such as the order amount and currency, as well as the accepted payment methods.

<Note>
  The endpoint to use is `POST https://buy.api.yabetoopay.com/v1/sessions`.
</Note>

```javascript
const response = await fetch("https://buy.api.yabetoopay.com/v1/sessions", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    total: 200000,
    currency: "xaf",
    accountId: "acct_xxxxxxxx",
  }),
});

const data = await response.json();
```

## Define a Product to Sell

Always store sensitive information about your product inventory (such as price, availability, etc.) on your server to prevent any customer from modifying it. Define your product details when creating the Checkout session.

```javascript
const items = [
  {
    productId: "prt_XoPjNH2l5Q1g19mIZPxqYWEXwRJzOmlNXhcb",
    quantity: 1,
    price: 200000,
    productName: "Écran LG",
  },
];
```

```javascript
const response = await fetch("https://buy.api.yabetoopay.com/v1/sessions", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    items,
  }),
});

const data = await response.json();
```

## Define Metadata (optional)

You can add metadata to your Checkout session to store additional information, such as the order ID, customer ID, and more.

```javascript
metadata: {
  orderId: "1234",
  customerId: "5678",
},
```

## Provide Success and Cancel URLs

Provide success and cancel URLs to redirect your customer back to your website after the payment. These URLs are used to inform the customer about the status of the transaction and to perform additional actions on your server, such as updating the order status.

```javascript
const successUrl = "https://votre-site.com/checkout-success";
const cancelUrl = "https://votre-site.com/checkout-cancel";
```

## Full exemple

The following example shows how to create a Checkout session with all the required parameters.

```javascript
const response = await fetch("https://buy.api.yabetoopay.com/v1/sessions", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    total: 200000,
    currency: "xaf",
    accountId: "acct_xxxxxxxx",
    successUrl: "https://votre-site.com/checkout-success",
    cancelUrl: "https://votre-site.com/checkout-cancel",
    metadata: { orderId: "1234" },
    items: [
      {
        productId: "prod_12345",
        quantity: 1,
        price: 200000,
        productName: "Écran HD",
      },
    ],
  }),
});

const data = await response.json();
```

### Response

The response contains the session ID and other details.

```json
{
  "accountId": "acct_iNXIGeot1lqyhGI5eP7KL0LcWTCTgFLytfRa",
  "successUrl": "https://votre-site.com/checkout-success",
  "cancelUrl": "https://votre-site.com/checkout-cancel",
  "orderId": "ord_KowaIWyMlD25Lhb8MyY3GQyvN8nFaxTZ7ji7",
  "expiresAt": "2024-05-28T13:33:51.760+00:00",
  "id": "session_ajrw3pQUUZD8UI2eFkWyUgLxJ4kGuXCoaQeb",
  "createdAt": "2024-05-28T12:33:51.762+00:00",
  "updatedAt": "2024-05-28T12:33:51.762+00:00"
}
```

## Redirect to Checkout

Once the Checkout session is created, redirect your customer to the hosted payment page URL. This URL is available in the Checkout session response.

## Redirect the Customer

Once the payment is completed, the customer is redirected to the success or cancel URL you specified in the `successUrl` or `cancelUrl` field.

Our system will add the transaction ID to your callback like this: `https://your_callback?paymentId={id}`. It is in your interest to verify the correct receipt of the payment by checking the status of the transaction in our system by following this process:

<Note>
  Sandbox : `https://pay.sandbox.yabetoopay.com/v1/payment-intents/{paymentId}`
</Note>

<Note>
  Production : `https://pay.api.yabetoopay.com/v1/payment-intents/{paymentId}`
</Note>

```javascript
const paymentId = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get("paymentId");

const response = await fetch(`${url}/${paymentId}`, {
  method: "GET",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY",
  },
});

const data = await response.json();

console.log(data);
```

### Why Perform a Double Verification?

1. **Security** : Ensures that the payment was genuinely made and that you do not process false transactions.
2. **Confidence** : By formally verifying the payment status via the API, you maintain a reliable record of successful and failed transactions.
3. **Prevention of fraud** : By verifying the payment status, you reduce the risk of potential fraud.

The redirect step after the payment is crucial for finalizing a transaction. By retrieving the payment ID provided in the URL and performing a double verification with the Yabetoo API, you reinforce the security of your order process and ensure that only confirmed payments are processed.

The use of a hosted checkout page with sessions of payment simplifies the process of integrating payments into your application. It allows you to delegate the management of sensitive data to Yabetoo, while offering a smooth and secure payment experience to your users.
