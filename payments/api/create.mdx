## What is a Payment Intent?

A payment intent is a resource that represents your wish to receive payment for a specific amount. When you create a payment intent, you don't immediately capture the amount; it's a preparatory step.

A payment intent tracks a customer's payment process. It records details such as amount, currency and payment method.

## Prepare your request

The endpoint to use is `POST https://pay.sandbox.yabetoopay.com/v1/payment-intents` for sandbox environment and `POST https://pay.api.yabetoopay.com/v1/payment-intents` for production environment.

<Note>
  Secret key security: The secret key (secret_key) must be kept confidential and
  must never be exposed in the frontend or client code. It must only be used on
  the server side.
</Note>

1. Use the secret key provided `secret_key` to authenticate yourself to the API. For security reasons, this key must only be used on the server side.
2. The request body should contain the following parameters:

```javascript
{
  amount: 2000,
  currency: "xaf",
  description: "Payment for product",
  metadata: { orderId: "1234" },
}
```

### Parameters

- `amount`: The amount to be paid
- `currency`: The currency of the payment
- `description`: A description of the payment (optional)
- `metadata`: Additional metadata (optional)

## Create a Payment Intent

You can create a payment intent by using the following code, this example is in JavaScript (Node.js) but you can use any language you want just by following the same logic.

```javascript
const response = await fetch(
  "https://pay.sandbox.yabetoopay.com/v1/payment-intents",
  {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      amount: 2000,
      currency: "xaf",
    }),
  }
);

const data = await response.json();
```

## Response
